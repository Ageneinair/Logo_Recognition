# Logo Recognition
Author: [Xipeng Xie](https://github.com/Ageneinair)

This repository is a demo for detecting and recognizing logos in the image.
The dataset I used is [Flickr Logos 27 dataset](http://image.ntua.gr/iva/datasets/flickr_logos/), which contains 27 types of logo, but in this demo only Pepsi and CocaCola would be detected.
